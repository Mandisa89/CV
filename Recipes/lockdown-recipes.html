        <h3>Delicious and refreshing</h3>
        <p>This recipe was originally found on <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/lemon-sorbet" target="_blank">BBC Good Food</a>, though I had to increase the amount of everything's ratio to the sugar, since it turned out <span>way too sweet<span> when I followed the recipe. Consequently, I ended up with two tubs of lemon sorbet! No complaints here.</p>
         <h3>Let's get started</h3>
          <p>Before we begin, let me say this: Trust your own tastebuds. Add more water and lemon juice as you see fit. Also, I personally have not used any vodka in this before (Lockdown prohibition), so do let me know how it works out!</p>
        <table class="ingredients">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Ingredient</th>
              <th scope="col">Amount</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>

            </tr>

              <td headers="Amount">1/2 litre</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td headers="Ingredients">Lemon Zest</td>
               <td headers="Amount">2 teaspoons</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td headers="Ingredients">Lemon Juice</td>
              <td headers="Amount">10 lemons</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td headers="Ingredients">Vodka</td>
              <td headers="Amount">2 teaspoons</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Heat the half litre of water, the sugar and the lemon peel in a small pan until the sugar has dissolved, then bring the mixture to the boil. Cook for 3 mins, then turn off the heat and leave to cool. Pick out the lemon peel and discard. Add your lemon juice to the sugar mixture along with the vodka, if you're using some.</li>
            <li>
              Though pretty obvious, I found old ice cream tubs worked best as containers, though I should mention the caveat. The smaller the tub, the quicker your lemonade will turn to sorbet. Otherwise, you might be crushing ice crystals all day - which is what I did. 
              </li>
              <li>Pour the mix into your freezer box of choice and freeze for 1hr 30 mins. Then, mix up with a whisk to break up and incorporate the ice crystals (which will be starting to form at the edges) before returning to the freezer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep mixing the sorbet once an hour for between 4 to 6 hours to break up the ice crystals. I found our potato masher the best tool for this. Stop mixing when firm but still scoopable, then store in the freezer for up to 1 month. 
            </li>  
            <li>
                Serve scoops of sorbet decorated with a few curls of lemon zest, some leaves of mint.
            </li>
            <li> 
              Go nuts.
            </li>

        <h3>Fresh bread every morning? Heck yeah.</h3>
        <p>This recipe was originally found at <a href="https://www.prohomecooks.com/post/15-mistakes-for-sourdough" target="_blank">Pro Home Cooks</a>.</p>
             <p>For years, I've had to diligently walk past the bins stacked with Portuguese Rolls, Pumpernickel bread, and sweet, sweet loaves of sourdough. <q>Priorities!</q>, I would tell myself. <q>One cannot have Lindor chocolates <em>and</em> fancy bread.</q> At least not at the frequency that I would like. And so I'd steer myself towards the healthiest-looking Albany loaf in the store. If it had seeds in it, it couldn't be all that bad.</p>
             <p>
               Then the lockdown was implemented. If you're not from South Africa, let me tell you that news footage of the military shooting rubble bullets at media, and stories of people with bogus reasons for being outside their homes being arrested on the spot, was plenty to make me err on the side of safety, and stay off the roads.</p>
             <p>If the COVID-19 lockdown was good for one thing, it certainly taught us how to make do with - and appreciate - what we have.</p>
             <p>After we basically ran out of everything (even those cans at the very back of the pantry - you know), instead of buying bread, and instead of giving in to the temptation to buy just that one packet of biscuits, and maybe some rusks, we decided it would be best to buy the magic main ingredient of it all. Flour. 
             </p>
             <p>After we "disgraced" the sourdough starter our friends had so generously given us by feeding it with white, bleached flour, we started over, and made our own, using Eureka Mill's Brownbread flour, following this video by Joshua Weissman.</p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTAiDki7AQA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
