        <h3 class="handwritten-large">Fresh bread every morning? Heck yeah.</h3>
        <p>This recipe was originally found at <a href="https://www.prohomecooks.com/post/15-mistakes-for-sourdough"
                target="_blank">Pro Home Cooks</a>.</p>
        <p>For years, I've had to diligently walk past the bins stacked with Portuguese Rolls, Pumpernickel bread, and
            sweet, sweet loaves of sourdough. <q>Priorities!</q>, I would tell myself. <q>One cannot have Lindor
                chocolates <em>and</em> fancy bread.</q> At least not at the frequency that I would like. And so I'd
            steer
            myself towards the healthiest-looking Albany loaf in the store. If it had seeds in it, it couldn't be all
            that
            bad?</p>
        <p>
            Then the lockdown was implemented. If you're not from South Africa, let me tell you that news footage of the
            military shooting rubble bullets at media, and stories of people with bogus reasons for being outside their
            homes being arrested on the spot, was plenty to make me err on the side of safety, and stay off the roads.
        </p>
        <p>If the COVID-19 lockdown was good for one thing, it certainly taught us how to make do with - and appreciate
            - what we have.</p>
        <p>After we basically ran out of everything (even those cans at the very back of the pantry - you know which
            ones I mean), instead
            of buying bread, and instead of giving in to the temptation to buy just that one packet of biscuits, and
            maybe
            some rusks, and maybe just one more something....we decided it would be best to buy the magic main
            ingredient
            of it all. Flour.
        </p>
        <p>After we "disgraced" the sourdough starter our friends had so generously given us, by feeding it with white,
            bleached flour, we started over, and made our own, using Eureka Mill's Brownbread flour, following this
            video
            by Joshua Weissman.</p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTAiDki7AQA"

            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Basically, all you do is let a simple mix of flour and water ferment on your windowsill, and catch the
            naturally-occuring bacteria. May sound a little gross, but think about all the other fermented foods we eat
            -
            like yoghurt, beer, Kombucha.
            It's all the same, really.</p>

        <p>What I have learned over the past few weeks of baking bread is that, like anything, it’s not as difficult as
            it seems at first, once you do it a couple of times. I was terribly nervous that I would mess up the bread
            somehow. But you know what? Even when I completely under-salted the dough, didn’t feed my starter regularly
            the week I was going to use it, forgot to preheat the dutch oven, or made any number of other rookie
            mistakes,
            I ended up with something freshly made and bread-like to go with a warm bowl of soup, or an excuse to make a
            million salad croutons.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess what I’m saying is that the worst-case results of you getting something wrong is nothing to be
            nervous
            about.
        </p>
        <h3 class="handwritten-large">With that, let’s jump in.</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to incorporate bread-making into the rest of my day has been as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Feed the starter the night before, with a 100g of flour, and 100g of water.
            </li>
            <li>In the morning, which for me is around 8:00, grab a large bowl, pour in your 6 cups of flour and mix in
                your ca. 4 cups of water.
            </li>
            <li>If you don’t usually bake and don’t have a measuring cup, use a whiskey glass or fill your regular-sized
                tea mug to about 60%.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a kitchen bowl and leave to autolyse (meaning, for the gluten bonds to form) for
                around 45min. It being winter, I like to leave it on the kitchen counter in the sun to get things going.
            </li>
            <li>For the cleanups-as-you-go, try soaking whatever utensils you use in water and then rubbing the dough
                off
                by hand. I’ve ruined many a kitchen cloth, scouring brush and sponge by caking it in dough. That
                water-flour
                combination is death to fibrous material, so I also suggest using a dry cloth to wipe any flour off your
                kitchen counter.
            </li>
            <li>After about 45min, stretch the dough sideways so that there is a little crater in the centre. Sprinkle
                in
                your generous palm-full of salt, followed by a generous fist-sized blob of starter.
                Stretch the dough sideways and fold it over, back to the centre. Repeat about five times, and let it
                rest
                for 30min.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat stretch-and-fold every 30minutes for about three hours. The dough should firm up and become more
                supple throughout this process. The dough is ready to rest and let rise (ferment) once you can stretch
                the
                dough so thinly that you can see your finger through it, without the dough tearing. This is called the
                window-pane test.
            </li>
            <li>Leave your dough to bulk-rise for 4 hours or so. For this, I also like to cover it with a cloth and
                leave
                it on the sunny kitchen counter. The dough won’t double in size like when working with baker’s yeast,
                but
                you should see some growth. I like to wait until the dough grows some decently-sized bubbles at least.
            </li>
            <li>Once you are happy with your bulk-rise, pour your dough onto the kitchen counter, and divide into two
                parts. Since I don’t have a good scraper, or a counter that would take kindly to being scraped, I dust
                the
                counter surface with flour first. If you can avoid doing this, it’s all the better, since the added
                flour
                will make
                the dough a lot less sticky.
            </li>
            <li>Stretch your dough sideways, and fold the folds back over each other into the centre. Start at the top
                of
                your rectangle of dough, and repeat twice more to the bottom. Then roll into a ball from the bottom up.
            </li>
            <li>Lay a kitchen cloth inside a bowl and dust it generously with flour. Sprinkle your handful of seeds in
                too.
            </li>
            <li>Place your ball of dough in the bowl, dusting any spots that look like the dough might stick to with
                more
                flour.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the ball of dough (I usually dust the top of the dough with some more flour and then fold the rest
                of the kitchen cloth over it), and leave it in the fridge overnight. I have found the longer the
                process,
                the more flavourful the bread ends up being.
            </li>
            <li>By the morning, if you poke your the dough, and it springs back, leaving just a shallow dent, it is
                “proofed”, and ready for baking! If you poke it and it doesn’t spring back, it is “underproofed” and
                needs
                some more time. If it springs back and leaves no dent at all (which I think I have seen once), it is
                “overproofed”. I’m not sure what the solution to overproofing is, and what the downsides may be (maybe
                your
                crumb might not be as big, or perhaps the opposite), but I promise - your bread will turn out edible.
            </li>
            <li>Heat your oven to maximum (which, on our gas oven, is 260C) and let your dutch oven heat up for 45min.
            </li>
            <li>Take out the dutch oven. Take a sheet of baking paper, place it over your proofing basket (that bowl
                lined
                with a kitchen towel that your dough ball was sleeping in) and flip it upside down, placing your dough
                ball
                onto the baking paper. You should see the seeds you had sprinkled into your proofing basket embedded in
                the
                top. Neat!
            </li>
            <li>Place everything into the dutch oven, close the lid, and bake for 25min on high.
            </li>
            <li>After 25min, “spring” the oven (aka, take the lid off), and bake your loaf of bread on 230C for another
                25min.
            </li>
            <li>Check if your loaf has turned nice and golden brown. If it’s ready to come out, I find flipping the loaf
                of bread onto an oven mix the easiest way to get it out. Make sure to do this over a counter in case it
                slips out of your hands. Then, just let the loaf rest for an hour (and resist the temptation to cut it
                open
                early).
            </li>
            <li>Now repeat the same process with your second loaf. Once you’re done baking it, you can just turn off the
                oven, and leave it to mellow some more in the remaining heat.
            </li>
            <li>After you’ve let it rest and cool down, reward yourself with a warm slice and give yourself a
                well-deserved pat on the back for extending your skillset, and in such a damn delicious way.</li>
        </ol>
