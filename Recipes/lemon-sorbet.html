        <h3 class="handwritten-large">Delicious and refreshing</h3>
        <p>This recipe was originally found on <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/lemon-sorbet"
                target="_blank">BBC Good Food</a>, though I had to increase the amount of everything's ratio to the
            sugar,
            since it turned out <span>way too sweet<span> when I followed the recipe. Consequently, I ended up with two
                    tubs of lemon sorbet! No complaints here.</p>
        <h3 class="handwritten-large">Let's get started</h3>
        <p>Before we begin, let me say this: Trust your own tastebuds. Add more water and lemon juice as you see fit.
            Also, I personally have not used any vodka in this before (Lockdown prohibition), so do let me know how it
            works out!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the half litre of water, the sugar and the lemon peel in a small pan until the sugar has dissolved,
                then bring the mixture to the boil. Cook for 3 mins, then turn off the heat and leave to cool. Pick out
                the
                lemon peel and discard. Add your lemon juice to the sugar mixture along with the vodka, if you're using
                some.</li>
            <li>
                Though pretty obvious, I found old ice cream tubs worked best as containers, though I should mention the
                caveat. The advantage of a smaller tub is that your lemonade will start freezing more quickly. If you
                use a
                large tub, the process of freezing and crushing
                ice crystals might take all day - which is what ended up happening my first time around.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the mix into your freezer box of choice and freeze for 1hr 30 mins. Then, mix up with a whisk to
                break up and incorporate the ice crystals (which will be starting to form at the edges) before returning
                to
                the freezer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep mixing the sorbet once an hour for between 4 to 6 hours to break up the ice crystals. I found our
                potato masher the best tool for this. Stop mixing when firm but still scoopable, then store in the
                freezer
                for up to 1 month.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve scoops of sorbet decorated with a few curls of lemon zest, some leaves of mint.
            </li>
            <li>
                Go nuts.
            </li>
        </ol>
